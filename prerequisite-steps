You will need to have installed docker prior to starting any of the setup obviously.

Enable SSH on your Synology box and run the following as root replacing IPs and interfaces as required:

docker network create -d macvlan -o parent=eth1 --subnet=192.168.1.1/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 --ip-range=192.168.1.5/32 PiHole
